# NOTES
# The hash references the hash itself, and the key parameter is the missing
# key. With this, you can initialize default values in the hash before they get
# accessed. Here are a few interesting things you can do with a hashâ€™s
# initialization block.

# this line of code: hash = Hash.new{ |h,k| h[k] = 0 }

# LS Note:
# we will get an exception the first time counts[word.size] += 1 is executed.
# This is because that element doesn't exist, so counts[word.size] returns nil,
# and nil cannot be added to 1. To fix this, we use the default value form of
# initializing counts:
# counts = Hash.new(0
